Prompt:

This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the login function.

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that logs in to the application as theÂ `administrator`Â user.

What are we looking for?
	We are looking for vulnerability when user signs in. 
What is the end goal?
	End goal is to preform an attack and log in as administrator.
Analysis 
	1. SELECT firstName FROM users where  username = 'admin' and password = 'admin'
	   This produced "Invalid username or password." meaning error handling doesn't indicate which field is wrong or right
	2. SELECT firstName FROM users where  username = " ' '" and password = 'admin'
	   This produced Internal Server Error meaning something was sent to backend. 
	3. SELECT firstName FROM users where  username = "admin--" and password = 'admin'
	   This produced Invalid username or password again. Lets try to use the prompt keyword administrator next time.
	4. SELECT firstName FROM users where  username = "administrator'--" and password = 'admin'
	   This prompted a modal that stated to change password but led to user being attacked ![[SQL Material PortSwigger#^teoorq]]


Solution 
1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the login request.
2. Modify theÂ `username`Â parameter, giving it the value:Â `administrator'--`
